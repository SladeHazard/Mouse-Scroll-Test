# Mouse-Scroll-Test
Here's a simple Python program to test your mouse scroll wheel. The line will show red when scrolling down and green when scrolling up. This is helpful if your mouse randomly scrolls up while you're scrolling down.


There is also an option to test your other mouse clicks for any double clicks or activation issues.


# Requirements
`pip install pygame`
